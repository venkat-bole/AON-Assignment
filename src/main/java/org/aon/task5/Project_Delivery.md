Currently, I'm working in a small team where we deliver projects and enhancements received from the business.

But the delivery of the following project is something I feel proud where it comes value it has given to the business.

# Claims re-lodgement system:

### The Problem: 
When any online claim lodgement failed due to the connection issues with the legacy systems, business request for an XML payload for lodging it manually.

### Solution
As part of innovation, I have involved in design and coding of this highly integrated system which 
1. Captures all the failures during orchestration of lodgement.
2. Provides a view for the reporting
3. Gives ability for resubmission

### Critical aspects
1. [x] Understanding pain points from business/users
2. [x] Finding the right solution which is robust and cost-effective.
3. [x] Customer satisfaction
4. [X] Business impact
