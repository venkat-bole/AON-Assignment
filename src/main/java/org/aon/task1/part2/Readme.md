There are alternative approaches for measuring method execution times more conveniently and flexibly:

1. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
```java
@Aspect
public class TimerAspect {
    @Around("execution(* org.aon.test.*.*(..))")
    public Object measureMethodTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        try {
            return joinPoint.proceed();
        } finally {
            long duration = System.nanoTime() - start;
            Logger.log(joinPoint.getSignature() + " took " + 
                       TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(duration) + " ms");
        }
    }
}
```
Pros:
- Can automatically time all methods in a package
- No need to modify existing code
- Can add logging, error tracking simultaneously
- Works across entire application

2. Modern Observability Libraries
```java
// Using Micrometer for metrics
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Timed(value = "user.operations")
    public void processUser(User user) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```
Pros:
- Integrates with monitoring systems
- Collects comprehensive metrics

Considerations for Choosing an Approach:
- Performance overhead
- Granularity needed

Recommendation:
- For small projects: Functional Utility or Annotation-Based
- For enterprise: AOP or Observability Libraries
- For deep performance analysis: Profiling Agents

Each approach has trade-offs between:
- Invasiveness of code changes
- Performance impact
- Depth of insights
- Ease of implementation

However, best choice always depends on project specific requirements.
