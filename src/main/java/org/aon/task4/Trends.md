Have observed the following trends from the last two to three years

1. Using AI in application development and automation
2. Increased focus towards application security and DevSecOps
3. Moving to Cloud and Cloud-Native development

### AI and Automation

Among these, using AI and Automation are influencing most in the application development as follows.

1. Boosting application development using AI as there are many AI tools (including Low-code and no-code platforms) available online which can generate code and unit tests.
2. Achieve faster time to market
3. Cost efficiency
4. Automation in application testing

In order to prepare for this trend, I'm

1. [x] Learning basics of Gen AI
2. [x] Learning Promt engineering
3. [x] Exploring oline AI tools and understand how they works etc.

### Application Security and Vulnerability Management

Observing an increased focus on application security and vulnerability management from organisations in order safe from online hacking and other attacks
which can damage reputation, brand and financial losses etc. Implementing many policies like zero trust.

Preparing my self to get hands on with
1. [x] OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities
2. [x] Secure coding from SAST to DAST
3. [x] Following DevSecOps 
4. [x] Continues vulnerability management using e2e monitoring tools
